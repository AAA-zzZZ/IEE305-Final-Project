# Product Lifecycle Management System (PLM) – Relational Database Implementation

##Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system** designed as part of a consulting-style project for the *Product Design Game* (Grogan and de Weck, 2019). 

The goal of the project was to transition from a spreadsheet-based PLM (Google Sheets) to a **relational database system**. The new system simplifies data management, provides cleaner SQL-based queries, and integrates with HTTP API endpoints to track manufacturing events in real-time.

The system tracks:
- Vehicle designs (code name, chassis type, unit cost, unit revenue)
- Teams and their design selections
- Chassis purchases (with unique serial numbers)
- Completed vehicle sales (with revenue tracking)
